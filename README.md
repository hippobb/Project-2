For the project 2, we use Node.js and Express.js to create a API and use Handlebars.js as the templating engine. Combine with MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database and make both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. Finally it is deployed using Heroku (with data). We use new technology google Oauth technology for login and multer for upload image to server.
